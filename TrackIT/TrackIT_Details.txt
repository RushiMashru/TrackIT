TrackIt
-------

 -> Computer should be on during the process.

Question:

1) Will excel sheet have dublicate entries (Same Project Owner & Same Project Name)?

2) What if computer was switched off for a day and program missed to send emails to Project Owner on that perticular day ?
- One of the solution: Possibly, program can look back and change missed date to current date.

3) Do we want to track defaulters ?

4) Which time of the day we want to track down the response i.e. we can add new entry of the defaulters after 15 days from current date ?

5) Few 	questions in sample file which was shared by Mon ?


-------

TrackIT 

-> Make subject and body dynamic and logical at same time.

-> Create a final excel file by using the one which TP shared and add the columns which can drive the program.

-> Critical point: TrackIT should work even if the excel was open at some point of time.

-> Get the feedback of new excel file and consume it in the program.

-> Package the solution and get it install in different machines and find and handel various scenarios.
